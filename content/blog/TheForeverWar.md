I've been on a bit of a military scifi kick here lately. Maybe it can be blamed on playing too much of the excellent [Helldivers 2](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/553850/) and watching _Starship Troopers_ again recently but after finishing up the [First Law Trilogy](@/blog/firstlawtrilogy.md) I was really hankering for something in the scifi space and this has been on my list for awhile. Once again, thanks to it being readily available via Libby and the public library it ended up next on my list of audiobooks to listen to.

I've read all the primary novels in John Scalzi's [Old Man's War](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40789-old-man-s-war) as well as a handful of lesser books in the genre so I was genuinely excited to finally get around to one of the classics of the genre.  Originally published in 1974, _The Forever War_ definitely feels more dated in 2025 than some of these more contemporary novels do.  Some of its assumptions about the advancement of technology were just flat out wrong and it feels jarring to read about periods of the 2010s and 2020s now where there is not an ever-present global internet or even the commonplace smartphone.  It also feels that many of the social issues that are brought up (namely homosexuality and to a lesser extent drug use) seem sort of blasé by today's standards.  In the novel, smoking pot is apparently legal and being gay can be seen as taboo or uncomfortable to our protagonist who is is displaced from his own time.  Maybe this was a greater social commentary in the final days of the Vietnam War era (of which Halderman was a veteran of) but it seemed to be more in the way of the narrative when read with modern eyes.

The novel's specific focus on certain periods of time, also led to a curious thought while reading: how many other novels published in the past and either make predictions of the future or commentary upon it, have already had the future time they pertain to pass?  The most famous of them, in my opinion at least, being _Back to the Future: Part II_ when Marty travels to the futuristic 2015. You, me, and every other child of the 90s is still waiting for the real hoverboard.  I kind of wanted to compile a list of said media and give it an accuracy rating for this post, but honestly if I waited to post this review until that was done then a 1000-year war would likely be a distant memory by the time I finished it.

Beyond the entertaining thought experiment of what media has passed its envisioned future, I mention it because I found that with the dates being as specific as they are, it's a bit jarring to the narrative at times to stop and think, "no, that's not how that ended up working out."

I've been a bit harsh on the book, but there are also some excellent ideas in the book as well. Having read other later works of military scifi, you can clearly see that many borrow bricks from the foundation that Halderman laid out here.  The senseless nature of human conflict, the everyman perspective of just trying to survive and retain some tattered shreds of your humanity, and of course the hallmark descriptive action pieces.  When the focus is on the conflict or its impact on the humans fighting it, Halderman's writing shines the clearest here.  It's probably also worthwhile to consider that _The Forever War_ is definitely used as a vehicle to convey the author's exploration of themes that were incredibly pertinent in 1970s America and to hold a mirror up to society at that time.

My only thought's on the audiobook narration itself is that it was competent but kind of drab.  When there are so many names of soldiers, many of who don't live long enough to get much personality anyway, the somewhat dry presentation of the narrator leads to sections where you can easily lose track of who is speaking.  In sections of dialog when more than two people are speaking this can become rather problematic.  This may be more an artifact of its time of release though as in recent years audiobook narrators like Jeff Hays and Travis Baldree have really upped the production values of audiobooks so maybe I'm a bit spoiled in my opinion there.

To conclude, I'd say _The Forever War_ is required reading for even casual fans of military scifi which I count myself among.  While elements may have not stood the test of time, the foundational ideas and concepts have left their fingerprint on many novels that have come after.
