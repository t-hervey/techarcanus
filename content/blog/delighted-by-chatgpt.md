An AI chatbot first happened to me today, while working with ChatGPT to create a mermaid.js flowchart, I ran into the limit where it says something along the lines of, "You've reached your limit in this conversation because of... please start a new chat or wait until..."

While that was mildly annoying, I had already gotten most of what I was looking for out of it and could take it from there.  However it was so dang useful and, dare I say it, friendly in the process of getting it to help me make this mermaidjs chart that it got me to click that little dropdown at the top and click the upgrade button because I was curious, just what are my pay for options if I was to put a little money down. Lo and behold that for $20 a month I could have so much more, and for a moment, I was tempted.  I wouldn't call myself a heavy use of ChatGPT but I do use it frequently, maybe daily.  And as the title suggests, I just keep finding delightful little things in ChatGpt.

The other day, while trying to solve a DNS issue to get this site working I honestly felt like it was cheering me on and it made me smile!

Here's the other weird thing I've found as I go back and forth with AI chat clients, the more conversational I get and start talking to them like a person instead of just a machine.  You can see it in my message above, I was excited. I got it working and typed a message much like I might have to one of my coworkers over slack and it responded in kind and tone.  Its darn impressive at times.

Recently I've also started to use the Google Gemini powered image generation tools in my presention slides.  At first I thought it was a gimmick but now I'm using it all the time to help find an image to add some zest to my presentations.  I was recently asked to do a career day talk at my son's school and I asked for an image of a robot making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and got this fun little image:

Earlier this evening I was poking around in the settings of ChatGPT to see if it had any sort of tracking of how many conversations I'd had with it and if it showed how many tokens or credits or whatever I'd maybe used recently (if it does, I didn't find it).  What I did find though is that you can customize the voice ChatGPT uses when it reads things to you.  I haven't used this feature myself yet, it's just a little too close to [_Her_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) for my liking but I still decided to play with the voices and hear what they each sounded like.  They all have kind of abstract names like, "Ember", "Sol", and "Breeze".  But there at the end of the list is one called, "Monday" and it's a hoot. You need to try it for yourself.

While I'm on the topic of things that I like about AI powered chat tools and maybe what I find most useful as a software developer is that with AI chat tools, there is no stupid question and the AI is an incredibly patient teacher.  There is zero recrimination for asking a question about Typescript that I should know but I don't because I live all day in C# code.  Unlike when you message a coworker with a question about a block of code they wrote and they don't get back to you or say, "just a sec, let me finish this first..." the AI is just there and can give you a run down of what something is doing.  Granted, it doesn't have all the context or history on why the code is the way it is, but if you just run into some new syntax you've never seen before or need some help parsing through some particularly gnarly code, its there to help you out with complaint.  I always tell my junior engineers, they can ask me anything, there is no stupid question.  Though I can say from personal experience that while the person you are asking really may mean that and don't feel that you are stupid for asking, I feel stupid for asking and showing someone what I don't know.  (Which that's a me problem to solve, nobody can be expected to know everything.)

There is a lot of quesitons and concerns I still have around AI and its uses, but sometimes (dare I say it?!?), its not only useful but a delight.
