It's not too often that I smile in general delight when reading my slack messages at work.  Usually my slack messages contain things like, "Is dev broken for you?", "Do you know why autofac can't find xyz?!?", or "quick question...".  It's exhausting to say the least.  The last couple of weeks have been particularly demanding on the slack front as I filled in for my team lead while he was taking some much deserved time off to get married and enjoy their honeymoon.

Today though as I was taking a heads-up break and scrolling through my slack channels looking for things I needed to read or respond to I clicked into our #random channel and found the following:

{{ feature_image(path="/content/blog/images/slack_message.png", width=0, height=110, op="fit_height", caption="❤️") }}

I smiled and chuckled a bit because I could hear the person who wrote the message saying it out loud and genuinely felt that all too rare glimmer of happiness and pride in the work that my team and I had done in writing this particular piece of software.  But the impact was so much more profound.  To put it into context, I woke up this morning with little desire to get to work and get to refactoring some code that was distributed across four or five different repositories.  In turn, I felt bad that I didn't feel motivated to work after a long holiday weekend.  Uninspired and demotivated by the job to be done I was feeling pretty glum and this is on top of all the normal day-to-day struggles with depression and general loathing I feel at times.

That one comment though turned my day around.  I don't need a lot of praise to feel rewarded in my work and too much praise can feel like pandering or lip service.  This though was just a random comment by someone who used the software I wrote.  It made their day better and their work easier to do.  Things clicked into place.  The work I do, the software I write, can make the jobs of others easier.  Then I thought, if this person finds our software useful, it's likely our other clients do too.  I went back to work feeling renewed and energized, yeah, this refactor isn't likely to have epic levels of impact on our user's day-to-day lives, but it was a component in service of the broader context of our software, and it was improving things.  I got back to coding, buoyed by those few words.   

As a software engineer who works remotely, it's really easy to become disconnected from those who use your software and the impact it has on their lives.  At previous job, I got to regularly interact with the people who used the software I wrote.  I'd pass them on the way to lunch and they would say something like, "hey, that thing you wrote saved us like 30 hours of manual processing this week, thanks!".  For me, it wasn't ever the praise that felt good, it was hearing that the thing I wrote made a positive impact, that it made their life better or improved their productivity.  That's what software engineers (or at least this one anyway) want to hear.  What was the impact the software had?  Did it make things better?  If not, how could we improve it to make it better and in turn make your job or life easier?
