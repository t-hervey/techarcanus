Recently a coworker said during a meeting, "You should ask ChatGPT who it thinks you are based on its conversations." Which got me to wondering what the chatbot would say about me if I posed similar questions to it.  I should provide some context that I don't tend to have personal conversations with ChatGPT.  I use it mostly as a resource to learn and figure things out.  It's been an incredibly helpful tool at times to figure out how to set up some technology stack I'm unfamiliar with, to parse error logs to find the pertinent bits, and to provide summaries and comparisons of different ideas and technologies.  I also sometimes use it as a design partner when fleshing out ideas for projects like a recent idea I had for a PI Pico based sound detector and have recently been attempting to see how well it can do at coming up with a first pass at some 3D models.

All of that to say, I don't really give a whole lot of personal information about myself to ChatGPT, but I was curious to see what it might have inferred or picked up on by my various queries.

Given the hours and hours that ChatGPT and I have spent in conversation, that's not much.  

My coworker also had ChatGPT generate an image of him based on his conversations.  While not a perfect depiction of him, you'd probably recognize him by the caricature-esque image that it came with.  I wanted to try the same and this is the rather odd result:

There are a few of things to point out here:
- I do not have a beard, nor do I wear glasses. (Well, unless I've stayed up too late and my contacts are drying out...)
- The office and PC arrangement is freakishly accurate. ðŸ¤¨
  - The fact that it knows I use [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) and Wayland isn't too surprising as I often use ChatGPT to troubleshoot and learn things there.
  - I do have a partially assembled Voron 3D printer in my office, though the Ender 3 is in another room.
  - The desk is actually correctly oriented to the position of the room I have it in.
  - However, it is making some assumptions about my decorating styles with those posters!  Maybe ChatGPT and I should have a conversation about legos sometime.

Got it. So ChatGPT knows more about my desk and computer than about me.  I think that's a good thing.

I was curious though, why did it assume I had a beard and glasses.  This is another game I like to play with chatbots and LLMs, asking it to explain why it made such assumptions. Its a trick I've picked up while working with copilot in software development.  When it makes a boneheaded decision and decides to randomly add some new properties to an object or something, I ask it to explain itself which usually leads to a new rule getting added to my copilot instructions file to explain when it shouldn't make assumptions on certain things.

An interesting response!  Does ChatGPT know I tend to stay up too late doing nerdy things like debugging stack overflows?!?  I wasn't about to go into more detail and answer the questions about my appearance though.  Let the machines keep guessing! ðŸ˜‰
