## Travis Hervey
Various titles and roles I go by:
- Husband 👫
- Father 👦👧👦
- Software Engineer 💻️
- Gamer (of both the video and tabletop varieties)
- All around nerd 🤓 and techno-wizard 🧙‍♂️

I've got too many interests and hobbies to list them all out here. Suffice to say I'm an experienced software engineer who enjoys a range of things including gaming, reading, hiking, and tinkering with various projects around the house.
