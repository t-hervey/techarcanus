"Hello world!"

How many times have I created a "hello world" app in my career?  Too many to count at this point I'm guessing.  But its a classic so for this site we are starting the same place.

I've wanted to put up a personal website for many years and I've always ended up strugging with one element or another.  Its either that I don't have time, I lack ideas, I get caught up the technical details...etc.

That last one, getting caught up in the technical elements, has probably been the biggest blocker.  I always think that I want to build something from scratch to flex my technical chops and learn whatever new framework is hot at the moment.  While the initial motivation is high I then run into the other problem of "having enough time".

So for this attempt I'm trying something different.  This blog is using [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) which lets me just write (mostly) plain old markdown and start making content quick.  I kind of abhor bloated content management systems like wordpress so something that parses text files and can be statically hosted appeals to me.  I'm also hoping that removing the barrier of building it from scratch means that I'll actually get to the point of actually making content this time around.
